### Problem 1:
Create a program that prints the user input until they enter 'q' to quit.

### Problem 2:
Ask the user for their name. Then ask the user for a number of times they want their name printed. Print the number of times the user want their name printed. If they enter a negative or zero, tell them to ask again.

### Problem 3:
Create a program that takes user input in a while loop. If they enter 1, print 1. If they enter 2, print 2. If they enter 3 print 3. If they enter ‘q’ or 0 (your choice), quit. Else, print “ERROR”.

### Problem 4:
Create a program that takes the user input until they enter 'q'. You should store all of their input and separate the input with a comma. Once they enter 'q', print all of the comma separated words they entered.
